# Full-stack Property Listing app

This is a full-stack TypeScript MERN app, which lets a user view a list of real estate properties in their web browser, and add new properties.

To avoid confusion with coding concepts of `properties` (e.g. in JavaScript objects), I will call them "houses" from now on (even though you could use it for apartments etc. of course).

## Requirements: 2-3hrs

### User stories

- User can **view a list** of properties
- User can **add** a new property
- A property has:
  - Postal address
  - Photo
  - Price

### Tech stack

- TypeScript
- Node app
- React app
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
- HTTP REST API
- FE State management: Redux
- CSS: plain CSS (would have gone for Styled Components with more time)
- Testing: Jest

### Tasks

#### UI

- List
- Form
- Responsive Design
- State management

#### API

- `GET /properties` () => fullList
- `POST /properties` (newHouse)=> updatedList

#### Tasks

- Error handling
- State management
- Testing: FE components & endpoints
- Readme documentation:
  - How to run
  - Next 20hrs

## How to run this app

### Ports

- Web browser for FE: http://localhost:3000/
- Postman for BE: http://localhost:8080

#### Install & run

**I. Without Docker**

1. Start up a MongoDB host
2. Open two terminals, and do these steps for each FE & BE:

```bash
cd # into folder
nvm use
npm i
npm build
npm run dev
```

3. Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

**II. Future feature: With Docker**

```bash
cd # into root
docker compose up --build
docker compose down
```

**Example house schema**:

- If the endpoints/database don't work, you can try inserting this in `server/src/http/handlers/get.ts` to mock the list in the web app:

```ts
const data: ReturnData = Array(10).fill({
  headline: "Big Mansion",
  price: "Â£200,000",
  imageUrl:
    "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577495508326-19a1b3cf65b7?q=80&w=1974&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D",
});
```

## Explaining some technical decisions

### Results

- I was running very short on time, so tried to show my approach to as many of the requirements as possible. That meant that I didn't completely tidy up the code or debug issues with the endpoints (request body issue), correct Jest mocks, fix React rendering, or set up Docker to run this app as intended.
- Requirements I skipped: Front-end state management (would have used Redux store and Apollo queries), Front-end testing, better schema-typing

### Explaining approaches

- MongoDB seemed a good database choice, as such early projects often change their schemas. I find MongoDB has easier forward-compatibility with less rigorous migrations necessary as Postgres.

- I was deciding between saving image files or urls in the database (with multer middleware). In the end I opted for `imageUrls`, as database images would have had a size limitations, and in a real app, I would use a cdn to store assets, e.g. AWS S3 buckets. So with more time, I would have connected AWS in the back-end server, and enabled a file uploader (maybe with drag & drop) UI on the front-end.

## Next 20 hours

Finish the requirements:

- Complete unit tests
- Redux state management
- Queries with Apollo
- Fix React rerenders
- More efficient & resilient types, Schema (perhaps with Typebox, just because I know that already)
- double-check edge cases, error handling. More sophisticated error codes
- Tidy up & refactor code
- Set up Docker
- Devops: GitHub actions for MRs and CI/CD pipelines, set up deployments (Netlify, db, backend), external logging

### Features

- List: enable pagination, sort, filters
- Add: Stricter form validation, formats
- Images: AWS cdn bucket, allow file upload (with drag & drop)
- Add an address finder
- Figure out auth: who is allowed to add new properties? Certain user-permissions
- Check security: CORS, injection
- Webpage basics: meta tags, favicon, page title, layout
- Complete the CRUD: update, delete an item. Page to view 1 item

#### Cool feature idea

- **Problem**: Competitors always show the same set of filters on the list page, but users have very individual tastes on what details are deal breakers or dealmakers (e.g. whether a property has a garden or not, what costs are/aren't included). I'm often opening 20 tabs with flats and then leave annoyed, because the details I care about are not clearly visible. Wastes everyone's time & money.
- **Idea**: on a DetailsPage of a property, users are able to click ðŸŒŸ ("important") or ðŸš« ("not important") on each detail (e.g. sq footage, parking spaces). Store these decisions, and use to show custom filters on the list page
